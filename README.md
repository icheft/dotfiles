@icheft Does Dotfiles

This repo contains more than just pure "dotfiles", it also contains some of my configurations in some other apps. 

This mainly serves as a backup to some of my existing "tools". I don't really know how to name the repo, and `dotfiles` seems just right for me. Any suggestions given are appreciated.

An introduction to dotfiles can be found [here](https://dotfiles.github.io).
